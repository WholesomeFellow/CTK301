            We're bees.
            We're the most perfectly
            functioning society on Earth.
            You ever think maybe things
            work a little too well here?
            Like what? Give me one example.
            I don't know. But you know
            what I'm talking about.
            Please clear the gate.

            - Wow.
            I've never seen them this close.
            They know what it's like
            outside the hive.
            Yeah, but some don't come back.
            - Hey, Jocks!
            - Hi, Jocks!
            You guys did great!
            You're monsters!
            You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
            - I wonder where they were.
            - I don't know.

            You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
            Jock. You have to be bred for that.
            Right.
            Look. That's more pollen
            than you and I will see in a lifetime.
            It's just a status symbol.
            Bees make too much of it. </p>
