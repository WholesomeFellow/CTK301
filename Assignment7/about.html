            Welcome to Honex,
            a division of Honesco
            and a part of the Hexagon Group.
            This is it!
            Wow.
            Wow.
            We know that you, as a bee,
            have worked your whole life
            to get to the point where you
            can work for your whole life.
            Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
            Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
            Our top-secret formula
            is automatically color-corrected,
            scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured </p>
        <p><a href="#">This is a link</a> into this soothing sweet syrup
            with its distinctive
            golden glow you know as...
            Honey!
            - That girl was hot.
            - She's my cousin!
            - She is?
            - Yes, we're all cousins.
            - Right. You're right.
            - At Honex, we constantly strive
            to improve every aspect
            of bee existence.
            These bees are stress-testing
            a new helmet technology.
            - What do you think he makes?
            - Not enough.
            Here we have our latest advancement,
            the Krelman.
            - What does that do?
            - Oatches that little strand of honey
            that hangs after you pour it.
            Saves us millions.

        <p>Can anyone work on the Krelman?
            Of course. Most bee jobs are
            small ones. But bees know
            that every small job,
            if it's done well, means a lot.
            But choose carefully
            because you'll stay in the job
            you pick for the rest of your life.
            The same job the rest of your life?
            I didn't know that.
            What's the difference?
            You'll be happy to know that bees,
            as a species, haven't had one day off
            in 27 million years.
            So you'll just work us to death?
            We'll sure try.
            Wow! That blew my mind!
            "What's the difference?"
            How can you say that?
            One job forever?
            That's an insane choice to have to make.
            I'm relieved. Now we only have
            to make one decision in life. </p>
